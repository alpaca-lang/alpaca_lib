{- Transform the contents of an option with a function to make a new option.

   If the option is `None`, the output will be `None` without running the
   supplied function.
   If the option contains something (`Some`) then the result will be a full
   option, the type of which is dictated by the supplied function.

   For example, the supplied function here will not actually be run, the result
   of this expression is still `None`:

   ```map (fn x -> x + x) None```

   Whereas here the result will be `4`:

   ```map (fn x -> x + x) Some 2```

   The output type is dependent on the supplied function so if we have a function
   `int_to_string` with the type `int -> string`, the following will yield an
   `option string`:

   ```
   -- the result will be Some "2":
   map int_to_string Some 2```
   ```
